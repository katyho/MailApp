 Deletes the message with the specified id.

 @discussion <h3>For standard IMAP accounts</h3>

 The `DELETE` method will delete messages from the source email server. In IMAP-speak, it will set the `\\Deleted` flag on the message and then call the `EXPUNGE` command.

 Once this is done, the message is gone forever, there's no way to bring it back.

 <blockquote>The `EXPUNGE` command removes all messages in that folder that have the `\\Deleted` flag set. If you want to avoid that, you can simply mark the message as deleted.</blockquote>

 <h3>For Gmail and Google Apps accounts</h3>

 For Gmail and Google Apps mailboxes, setting the `\\Deleted` flag and calling the `EXPUNGE` command is equivalent to removing a "label" and results in that message still showing up in the "All Mail" folder and other labels also assigned to the message. See this Gmail Support entry for details: http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=78755

 So, if you call the `DELETE` method on a message we assume it's because you wanted that message deleted. Therefore, what actually happens for Gmail or Google Apps messages is we move it to the "[Gmail]/Trash" folder.

 Create a folder on an IMAP source. A new folder can be added to an IMAP source by PUTting the desired path under the sources/folders resource.

 IMAP servers are free to use the character they want as the folder hierarchy delimiter. The bad news is they don't use the same. The good news is you don't need to know this, we take care of it.

 <h4>Then what is that <code>delim</code> parameter for?</h4>

 Good question. By default, we expect you to specify the folder hierarchy using `/` as the hierarchy delimiter. For example, to create a folder called `my folder` under the folder `base folder`, you would call:

 `PUT /2.0/accounts/<id>/sources/<label>/folders/base+folder/my+folder`
 No matter what's the actual hierarchy delimiter the IMAP server expects, this call will work. However, say you need to use another character as the delimiter, here's how you'd do it:

 `PUT /2.0/accounts/<id>/sources/<label>/folders/base+folder.my+folder?delim=.`

 Both examples above are equivalent and will have the same result no matter what the IMAP server expects as the actual hierarchy delimiter.
